- ... project governance and management (how)
- ... product development, refinement and documentation (what)

## Community- and customer-driven values and principles

The fundamental values and principles the project is based on should be open to the public and open for discussion. It is important that those values and principles, including this document, can be changed or extended. Project governance as well as product design have to conform to those values and principles. They are a part of the general appearance of the project and can serve as an additional reference point for customers’ trust.

Currently, the focus lies on:

- Transparency, i.e., making all data, without violating anyone's privacy, publicly available, accessible, and open for discussion
- Accessibility, i.e., allowing everyone with access to the public internet and an email address to use the platform

## Community- and customer-driven project governance and management

The project's governance and management should be open to the public and open for discussion. We need to discuss the policies and rules for how we work together and how we distribute responsibilities. It is also important to deliberate about the flow of value—on the one hand, value for customers, and on the other, profit for the project. For example, it is important that the procedure for determining the price of a product or service is publicly explained. Equally important is that this procedure itself is open for discussion and can be refined and extended by the community and customers.

## Community- and customer-driven product development, refinement, and documentation

Customers who are using a product or service know exactly the value it provides for their specific use case. The community and customers combined have a greater understanding and expertise of the market segment in general and of the product and service in particular. Therefore, it is important to define, refine, and document all features in public with the community and customers. Not only can the community and customers provide valuable information and decisions, but they can also provide implementations.
